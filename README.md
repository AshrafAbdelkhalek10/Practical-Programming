# C++ STL Algorithms Usage Example

This repository provides examples of using various Standard Template Library (STL) algorithms in C++. The examples cover a wide range of operations such as batch operations, search operations, copy operations, swap operations, transformation operations, removing operations, order-changing operations, sorting operations, binary search operations, set operations, min-max operations, permutation operations, numeric operations, arithmetic operations, comparison operations, and logical/bitwise operations.

## Usage

Each algorithm is demonstrated in a separate function within the `main.cpp` file. To view the example of a specific algorithm, navigate to the corresponding function within the file.
